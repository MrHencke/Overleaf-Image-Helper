# Overleaf Image Paste for Firefox
## Update
Overleaf now offers this feature natively, and this plugin is somewhat useless, thus it will be archived.

## Description
This is a heavily modified and somewhat expanded fork of the great project [cmprmsd/Overleaf-Image-Helper](https://github.com/cmprmsd/Overleaf-Image-Helper), turned into a native Firefox addon.

## Development
1. Clone the project
2. ```$ yarn install```
3. ```$ yarn build```
4. Go to about:debugging -> This Firefox
5. Load the temporary addon from the manifest file in dist/
6. Reload the addon when needed
